## Basic Details
 - Full Name
 - Email and GitHub Username
 - Your first language
 - Location and Timezone
 - Share links, if any, of your previous work on open source projects
 - Convince us that you will be a good fit for this project, by sharing links to your contribution to Sugar Labs


## Project Details
 - What are you making ? 
 - How will it impact Sugar Labs ?
 - What technologies (programming languages, etc.) will you be using ?

## Timeline:
 - Break down the entire projects into chunks and tell us what will you work on each week.<br>
   As the summer goes on, you and your mentor will adjust your schedule, but it's good to have a plan at the beginning so you have an idea of where you're headed.
 - If you will be off-the-grid for a few days, then mention those in the timeline.
 - GSoC 2023 has two evaluations, once after every 5 weeks.  Highlight the work you plan to complete before each evaluation.
 - How many hours will you spend each week on your project ?
 - How will you report progress between evaluations ?
 - Discuss your post GSoC plans. Will you continue contributing to Sugar Labs after GSOC ends ?
