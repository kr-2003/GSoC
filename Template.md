    *   Since I want to contribute to the VueJS implementation of Sugarizer, I tried implementing some components by myself. This is the link to the repository for the same:

    *   I am Abhinav Kumar, a current undergraduate pursuing a degree in Computer Science from IIT Indore in India. My passions lie in software development, competitive programming, and cybersecurity. Throughout the past year, I have been refining my skills in software development and data structures and algorithms. More recently, I have started to contribute to open-source projects, with a specific interest in cybersecurity. I am well-versed in various tech stacks, including VueJS, ReactJS, NextJS, Javascript, ExpressJS, FastAPI, and MongoDB. I have built an online gaming website with five multiplayer games, heavily utilizing Javascript, DOM manipulation, and Websockets. I have designed the logic behind these games, providing me with a wealth of experience with Vanilla JS and DOM manipulation. Furthermore, I have developed multiple websites using ReactJS and VueJS, giving me hands-on experience with JS frameworks.
    *   Since I already have good experience with Javascript, Typescript, VueJS and I have also contributed to open source projects based on these tech stacks, I find myself suitable for this project.
